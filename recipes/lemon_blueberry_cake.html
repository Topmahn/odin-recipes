      Let’s dive headfirst into this sunshine-sweet springtime layer cake… no
      matter the time of year!

    <h2>How to Make Lemon Blueberry Cake</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Fresh lemons.</strong> Use fresh lemon juice and lemon zest in
        the cake batter. None of that lemon extract stuff! How to choose lemons
        at the store? Make sure the lemons you choose are smooth-skinned and
        heavy for their size. That way you know they are extra juicy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Buttermilk.</strong> Known for providing exceptional moisture to
        baked goods, buttermilk leaves each bite tender and lush. If you don’t
        have buttermilk, you can use whole milk instead.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Brown sugar & 4 eggs:</strong> I’ve found that lemon cakes can
        easily be dry and gritty, so add some moist-making ingredients like
        brown sugar, eggs, and buttermilk. Buttermilk, a little brown sugar, and
        4 eggs assure the final product is as moist as it could possibly be
        without being wet.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fresh or frozen blueberries:</strong> Fresh or frozen
        blueberries are OK. If using frozen, do not thaw.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I love this lemon blueberry cake because the blueberries DO NOT sink to
      the bottom of the cake. Why not? The batter is thick. When you have a thin
      batter, heavy fruit or add-ins will sink to the bottom. I also recommend
      tossing the blueberries in a little flour too– this is extra insurance
      they don’t sink!

    <h1 id="top">Easy Homemade Sprinkle Cake</h1>
    <p>
      There’s nothing like sprinkle cake to make you feel like a kid again!
      Reminiscent of box cake mix, this homemade version is soft, moist, and
      loaded with rainbow sprinkles. It’s a single layer cake baked in a regular
      9-inch cake pan, so it’s perfect for smaller gatherings and celebrations.
      Top with vanilla buttercream for the ultimate birthday treat!

      down cake? I love looking back at older recipes, reading your reviews, and
      applying new techniques to make the recipes even better. With constant
      practice and recipe testing comes the opportunity to bring you the best
      content that I can. Baking is truly a science and I’m happy to continue to

    <h2>Improved Cake Recipe – Read the Difference</h2>
    <p>
      I published a homemade sprinkle cake recipe several years ago. It’s a
      wonderful one layer cake, but it often tasted overly dense and was prone
      to overflowing. Though I kept the original recipe written in the notes
      below, I want to share my new and improved version with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      This new sprinkle cake recipe, written below, is much softer than the
      original. Using (1) creamed butter instead of melted, (2) cake flour
      instead of all-purpose flour, (3) white sugar instead of brown sugar +
      white, and (4) just egg whites all guarantee a HUGE textural difference. I
      adapted it from my confetti sprinkle cupcakes and it’s the same base as my
      new pineapple upside down cake, too. We’re actually using the same
      ingredients in the updated recipe– just in different forms, ratios, and
      amounts.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Old Cake Recipe (in notes below):</strong> Overly heavy, dense,
        overflowed
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>New Cake Recipe (below):</strong> Softer, pleasantly moist,
        reduced amount of batter
      </li>

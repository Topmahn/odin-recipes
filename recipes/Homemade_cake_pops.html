      How was your weekend? We spent most of it celebrating my friend’s
      birthday. I made a whole mess of treats including this cake (as cupcakes),
      these cookies, and these cookies too– it’s been way too long since I made
      a batch of those in particular! The birthday girl loves chocolate and
      peanut butter and caramel so these 3 were a no brainer.

      There’s no batter time (get it? batter?) than a happy occasion to indulge
      in your favorite treats whether that’s a birthday, shower, wedding, you
      name it. My mom and sisters threw my baby shower last month and one of the
      treats they surprised me with was a HUGE display of cake pops. I love cake
      pops, but hardly ever take the time to make them. Though I did whip up a
      batch for both of my sisters’ bridal showers in the past few years.
      (Remember the green and pinks cake pops? They were for a bridal shower!)

    <p>See? Special occasions call for super special treats.</p>

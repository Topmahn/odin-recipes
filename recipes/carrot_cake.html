    <h1 id="top">My Favorite Carrot Cake Recipe</h1>
    <p>
      With its outstanding spice flavor, super moist crumb, and velvety cream
      cheese frosting, this is truly the best carrot cake. Use brown sugar and
      toasted pecans for deeper flavor.

      I don‚Äôt call it carrot cake. I call it ‚ÄúBirthday Cake.‚Äù It‚Äôs my one and
      only choice on my big day. I‚Äôve adopted this tradition and make my own
      carrot birthday cake each year. And, of course, we never limit it to only
      once per year. This cake graces our Easter table and I love making it for
      spring brunches, baby showers, and our community‚Äôs new bake sale.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      In fact, this carrot cake recipe is so popular around here that I stopped
      asking what everyone wants for dessert! Because it‚Äôs always this!
    </p>
    <p>
      And, finally, I firmly believe that the ONLY thing that competes with
      carrot cake is a batch of carrot cake cupcakes.

    <h2>What Does This Carrot Cake Taste Like?</h2>
    <p>
      This carrot cake sets the standard for carrot cakes everywhere. It‚Äôs
      deeply moist and filled with toasted pecans. Most of its flavor comes from
      brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and carrots. Ginger adds the most
      delicious zing, but it isn‚Äôt overpowering at all. The cake is dense, but
      each forkful tastes super soft and extra lush. If made ahead, the flavor
      intensifies and the cream cheese frosting seeps into the layers, creating
      an even more tender bite.
    </p>
    <p>
      So if you‚Äôre looking for a make-ahead cake whose taste and texture won‚Äôt
      be compromised, make this! It‚Äôs a total classic and 1 taste converts
      everyone, even those silly people who ‚Äúdon‚Äôt like carrot cake‚Äù. Who ARE
      you people?! üòâ

    <h2>How to Make Carrot Cake Moist</h2>
    <p>
      If it isn‚Äôt stick-to-the-back-of-your-fork moist, it‚Äôs just not worth it.
      So I worked to create an EXTRA moist carrot cake. Don‚Äôt skip these
      ingredients:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Brown Sugar:</strong> I‚Äôve come across a lot of carrot cake
        recipes that are sweetened with mostly granulated sugar. That‚Äôs great,
        but granulated sugar doesn‚Äôt do much for the cake besides sweeten it.
        Brown sugar not only sweetens cake, it produces so much flavor and
        moisture. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ the best!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Oil:</strong> Cakes need fat to make them soft and tender. When
        preparing cakes without super strong flavors such as vanilla cake and
        white cake, I prefer to use butter as the fat. Butter also gives them
        flavor. But for cakes like chocolate cake and carrot cake that have
        flavor from other ingredients, I find flavorless oil is the best choice
      </li>
      <li>
        Applesauce: To prevent the cake from tasting too moist (wet) and oily, I
        add some applesauce. You could even use crushed pineapple, too! These
        flavors pair beautifully with brown sugar and spices.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Freshly Shredded Carrots:</strong> My #1 tip for carrot cakes is
        to shred whole carrots at home. Do not use packaged pre-shredded carrots
        because they are hard and dry. You need about 4 large carrots for this
        recipe. And when you grate them, you‚Äôll notice how wet they are. That is
        PRIME moisture for your baked cake and you don‚Äôt want to skip it!
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Carrot Cake Success Tips</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Line your cake pans with parchment.</strong> Place your cake
        pans on a large sheet of parchment paper. Trace the bottom of the cake
        pan with a pencil, then cut the circles. Grease the pan and the
        parchment paper. Parchment paper rounds guarantee the cakes won‚Äôt stick!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make it ahead.</strong> One of the BEST parts about carrot cake
        is that it gets better with time, even after 1 full day. The flavors
        mingle, the moisture prevails, and the cream cheese frosting sets into
        the layers. It‚Äôs ridiculously good! You can make and frost the cake 1
        day in advance. Keep it covered in the refrigerator and bring to room
        temperature, if desired, before serving.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Use freshly grated carrots.</strong> Grate them yourself.</li>
    </ol>

    <h1 id="top">The Best Vanilla Cake I’ve Ever Had</h1>
    <p>
      With its outstanding vanilla flavor, pillowy soft crumb, and creamy
      vanilla buttercream, this is truly the best
      <strong>vanilla cake</strong> I’ve ever had. And after 1 bite, I guarantee
      you’ll agree.

      Out of all the cake recipes on my website, there’s a glaring absence.
      There’s white cake with a pristine soft crumb, vanilla naked cake with a
      flavorful tight crumb, and checkerboard cake with a whimsical design.

      What about a classic vanilla layer cake draped in vanilla buttercream? I
      already have homemade vanilla cupcakes and a 6 inch vanilla cake covered
      and now in all its crowning glory (and after plenty recipe testing
      catastrophes), I present you with cake perfection:

    <h2>Behind the Vanilla Cake Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      After years of cake successes and flops, I’m confident in this homemade
      vanilla cake. During my recipe testing, I combined my white cake recipe
      and naked cake recipe. These are two reader favorites and I knew they’d be
      the best starting point. At first there were too many eggs and I quickly
      learned sifting cake flour was NOT doing any favors.
    </p>
    <p>You need the following power ingredients:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Cake Flour:</strong> If you want a fluffy and soft bakery-style
        vanilla cake, cake flour is the secret. The cake will be denser and
        heavier using all-purpose flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Eggs & 2 additional egg whites:</strong> 3 whole eggs provide
        structure, moisture, and richness. 2 extra egg whites keep the cake
        light and airy. I don’t recommend using 4 whole eggs; stick to the 3 egg
        & 2 egg white combination.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Baking Powder & Baking Soda:</strong> Use both. Remember why?
        Using enough baking powder to give these layers height gave the cake a
        bitter aftertaste. Baking soda allows us to use less baking powder.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Buttermilk:</strong> Buttermilk is an acidic ingredient and baking soda requires
        an acid to work. Plus buttermilk yields an EXTRA moist cake crumb. See
        recipe note about the alternative.
      </li>
    </ol>

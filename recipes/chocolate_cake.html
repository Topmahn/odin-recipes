    <h1 id="top">Triple Chocolate Cake</h1>
    <p>
      This is my favorite homemade chocolate cake recipe. With a super moist
      crumb and fudgy, yet light texture, this chocolate cake recipe will soon
      be your favorite too. Top with chocolate buttercream and chocolate chips
      for 3x the chocolate flavor. You can also prepare this chocolate layer
      cake as a sheet cake, too. See recipe note.

      Originally published in 2013 and now with more in-depth descriptions, a
      helpful video tutorial, clearer instructions, and different ways to use
      this classic chocolate cake recipe. I hope you enjoy all the new features
      in this recipe post!

      <li>2 layers, but can be made as 3 layers or as a sheet cake</li>
      <li>Soft with a velvety crumb</li>
      <li>Deeply flavorful</li>
      <li>Unapologetically rich, just like my flourless chocolate cake</li>

    <h2>Chocolate Cake Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      Each ingredient serves an important role. For best results, do not make
      substitutions.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        All-Purpose Flour: The structure of the cake. Do not use cake flour–
        when combined with ultra-light cocoa powder, cake flour is too fine.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Unsweetened Natural Cocoa Powder:</strong> Do not use
        dutch-process cocoa powder. If you’re interested, see dutch-process vs
        natural cocoa powder for an in-depth explanation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Baking Soda & Baking Powder:</strong> Use both baking soda and
        baking powder for lift.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Salt:</strong> Salt balances the flavor.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Espresso Powder:</strong> Espresso powder is optional, but I
        recommend its addition because it enhances the chocolate flavor. The
        chocolate cake will not taste like coffee, I promise. I use espresso
        powder in my chocolate zucchini cake and marble loaf cake too!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Oil:</strong> Don’t use butter in this cake batter. Cocoa powder
        is a particularly drying ingredient, so this cake needs oil for suitable
        moisture.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Eggs:</strong> Use 2 room temperature eggs. To speed up the
        gently warming, place refrigerated eggs in a cup of warm water for 10
        minutes. Did you know what the temperature of your ingredients has a
        direct correlation to the success of your recipes? Unless otherwise
        noted, use room temperature ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Buttermilk:</strong> This chocolate cake requires the moisture
        and acidity from buttermilk. Lately I’ve been using a mix of sour cream
        and buttermilk, as well as reducing the hot liquid. You can read more
        about this next and see my dark chocolate mousse cake, tuxedo cake,
        black forest cake, and German chocolate cake recipes.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Vanilla Extract:</strong> Vanilla extract adds flavor.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hot Coffee or Hot Water:</strong> Hot liquid enhances the cocoa powder’s flavor.
        It also encourages it to bloom and dissolve appropriately. You’ll notice
        I don’t use hot liquid in my chocolate cupcakes recipe. That’s because
        there isn’t the same volume of dry ingredients. With this amount of cake
        batter, we need a hot liquid to break up the cocoa powder lumps resting
        in all that flour. If you don’t drink coffee, you can use hot water. For
        deeper and darker flavor, though, use coffee. (Decaf coffee works!)

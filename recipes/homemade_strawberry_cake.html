    <h1>Homemade Strawberry Cake</h1>
    <p>
      The one thing that sets this strawberry cake apart from others? Reduce
      fresh strawberry puree down and add to the best white cake batter.

      This strawberry cake completely blew me away. After years of mediocre
      from-scratch strawberry cakes, my expectations were pretty low. It was
      time to taste test my efforts. Biting into the first pastel pink forkful
      was the moment of truth…

      I cried tears of joy. Or were those actual tears because I just dirtied
      every dish with all this strawberry cake recipe testing?

    <p>Let’s get down to business. Watch me make the recipe below:</p>
    <p>
      I find it challenging to pack real strawberry flavor into cake without the
      crutch of fake strawberry flavoring. My goal was to create a strawberry
      layer cake made entirely from real strawberries. We’re talking
      strawberries inside the cake and in the frosting as well. With the help of
      freeze-dried strawberries, I tackled strawberry frosting. I’ll get to that
      below. But for strawberry cake? Things have always been pretty lackluster
      in the flavor and texture department.
